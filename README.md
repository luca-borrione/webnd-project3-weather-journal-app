# Weather-Journal App Project

## Demo:

This project has been published to my personal heroku account and can be viewed visiting<br /> [https://my-weather-journal-app.herokuapp.com/](https://my-weather-journal-app.herokuapp.com/)

## Overview:

This is the third assessment project for the Udacity's [Front End Web Developer Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0011)

It requires the student to create an asynchronous web app that uses the [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) API and user data to dynamically update the UI for a Weather-Journal App.

The project I realised meets the [project specifications](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2655/view) required by Udacity.

## Extras:

- The app auto detects the preferred language set on the browser and will localise the content accordingly
- The code is fully tested with unit tests using Jest
